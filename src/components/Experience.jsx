            I contributed to the development of the Hospital Information System
            (HIS) for the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC), the
            largest government hospital under the Department of Health (DOH). My
            responsibilities included managing and maintaining the system’s
            databases, as well as implementing new features and improvements to
            enhance overall functionality and user experience. I worked closely
            with the development team to identify priorities, plan enhancements,
            and ensure that updates aligned with the hospital’s operational
            requirements and technical standards.

            I am currently assigned under the City General Services Office of
            Tandag City, Surigao del Sur, where I independently developed and
            continue to manage the Inventory and Procurement Management System.
            This system streamlines the processes of purchase requests,
            inventory tracking, and asset monitoring, with QR code integration
            for efficient identification and management of items. I handled the
            end-to-end development — from planning and database design to
            implementation and deployment — ensuring the system meets the
            operational needs of the office while improving accuracy,
            accountability, and workflow efficiency.

            I was later reassigned to the Provincial Tourism Office of Surigao
            del Sur to lead the development of the official tourism website. As
            the sole developer handling the project, I am responsible for the
            end-to-end development process — from requirements gathering and
            design to development, deployment, and maintenance. The goal of the
            website is to promote the province's local destinations, culture,
            and events, while providing relevant information to both tourists
            and stakeholders. The project aims to enhance the digital presence
            of Surigao del Sur and support its tourism initiatives through a
            user-friendly and informative online platform.

            I am a full-time college professor at Saint Theresa College of
            Tandag, where I specialize in teaching programming-related subjects.
            I primarily handle courses in Basic Programming, Object-Oriented
            Programming (OOP), and Database Management. My role involves not
            only delivering lectures but also designing course materials,
            creating hands-on activities, and guiding students through practical
            applications of programming concepts. I strive to help students
            build a strong foundation in software development by integrating
            real-world scenarios and project-based learning into my teaching
            approach.
